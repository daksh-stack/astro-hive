AstroHive is a smart AI assistant system for space missions. It uses OPEA-compliant microservices to help rovers, satellites, and Earth stations work together. Each part runs its own AI to answer questions, give summaries, and send alerts â€” even offline. All data and actions are shown in a simple mission dashboard using real or simulated data.
